    about:
      'The new R5 frame is 130g lighter than the previous model—a 16% reduction from an already-light frame.  And while aerodynamics weren’t a focus with this frame the way they would be on an S5 or P5, bringing the cables inside reduced drag by 25g.',

    description: 'V IS FOR VELOCITY',
    about:
      "In pursuit of speed, everyone wants to try different positions to find their most aggressive fit. The S5's iconic V-stem not only inspires confident handling at high speeds, it's now also remarkably simple to dial in your perfect set-up. All the necessary spacers come with the bike, and there’s now only one bolt length, reducing complexity and making the system 53g lighter in the process.",

    description: 'FAST LIKE S5, LIGHT LIKE R5',
    about:
      'Soloist sits right between S5 and R5 on the performance scale, while having a price tag that’s less World Tour, more Road Trip. It’s about 250g heavier than R5, and 250g lighter than S5. It’s 190g slower than S5, but 126g faster than R5. You get the idea. It’s the ‘just-right’ answer for the rider trying to find a smart, intentional compromise.',
